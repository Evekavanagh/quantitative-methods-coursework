# Quantitative Methods Coursework

This repository contains coursework, laboratory exercises, and applied projects completed as part of my university studies in **quantitative and computational finance**, with a particular focus on the module **Advanced Computational Finance**.

The material emphasises numerical methods, simulation techniques, and computational approaches used in modern financial modelling.

## Module Focus: Advanced Computational Finance

The coursework in this repository covers topics including:

- Derivative pricing using analytical and numerical methods
- Monte Carlo simulation under risk-neutral dynamics
- Binomial tree models for European and American options
- Control variates and antithetic variates for variance reduction
- Estimation of option sensitivities (Greeks)
- Pricing of path-dependent and barrier options
- Portfolio risk and sensitivity analysis
